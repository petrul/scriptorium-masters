   <text:p text:style-name="Subtitle">CLOCKS.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="First_20_paragraph"><text:line-break/></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="Text_20_body">There are two kinds of clocks. There is the clock that is always wrong, and that knows it is wrong, and glories in it; and there is the clock that is always right—except when you rely upon it, and then it is more wrong than you would think a clock <text:span text:style-name="T3">could</text:span> be in a civilized country.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="Text_20_body">I remember a clock of this latter type, that we had in the house when I was a boy, routing us all up at three o&apos;clock one winter&apos;s morning. We had finished breakfast at ten minutes to four, and I got to school a little after five, and sat down on the step outside and cried, because I thought the world had come to an end; everything was so death-like!</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="Text_20_body">The man who can live in the same house with one of these clocks, and not endanger his chance of heaven about once a month by standing up and telling it what he thinks of it, is either a dangerous rival to that old established firm, Job, or else he does not know enough bad language to make it worth his while to start saying anything at all.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="Text_20_body">The great dream of its life is to lure you on into trying to catch a train by it. For weeks and weeks it will keep the most perfect time. If there were any difference in time between that clock and the sun, you would be convinced it was the sun, not the clock, that wanted seeing to. You feel that if that clock happened to get a quarter of a second fast, or the eighth of an instant slow, it would break its heart and die.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="Text_20_body">It is in this spirit of child-like faith in its integrity that, one morning, you <text:soft-page-break/>gather your family around you in the passage, kiss your children, and afterward wipe your jammy mouth, poke your finger in the baby&apos;s eye, promise not to forget to order the coals, wave at last fond adieu with the umbrella, and depart for the railway-station.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="Text_20_body">I never have been quite able to decide, myself, which is the more irritating to run two miles at the top of your speed, and then to find, when you reach the station, that you are three-quarters of an hour too early; or to stroll along leisurely the whole way, and dawdle about outside the booking-office, talking to some local idiot, and then to swagger carelessly on to the platform, just in time to see the train go out!</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="Text_20_body">As for the other class of clocks—the common or always-wrong clocks—they are harmless enough. You wind them up at the proper intervals, and once or twice a week you put them right and &quot;regulate&quot; them, as you call it (and you might just as well try to &quot;regulate&quot; a London tom-cat). But you do all this, not from any selfish motives, but from a sense of duty to the clock itself. You want to feel that, whatever may happen, you have done the right thing by it, and that no blame can attach to you.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="Text_20_body">So far as looking to it for any return is concerned, that you never dream of doing, and consequently you are not disappointed. You ask what the time is, and the girl replies:</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="Text_20_body">&quot;Well, the clock in the dining-room says a quarter past two.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="Text_20_body">But you are not deceived by this. You know that, as a matter of fact, it must be somewhere between nine and ten in the evening; and, remembering that you noticed, as a curious circumstance, that the clock was only forty minutes past four, hours ago, you mildly admire its energies and resources, and wonder how it does it.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="Text_20_body">I myself possess a clock that for complicated unconventionality and light-<text:soft-page-break/>hearted independence, could, I should think, give points to anything yet discovered in the chronometrical line. As a mere time-piece, it leaves much to be desired; but, considered as a self-acting conundrum, it is full of interest and variety.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="Text_20_body">I heard of a man once who had a clock that he used to say was of no good to any one except himself, because he was the only man who understood it. He said it was an excellent clock, and one that you could thoroughly depend upon; but you wanted to know it—to have studied its system. An outsider might be easily misled by it.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="Text_20_body">&quot;For instance,&quot; he would say, &quot;when it strikes fifteen, and the hands point to twenty minutes past eleven, I know it is a quarter to eight.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="Text_20_body">His acquaintanceship with that clock must certainly have given him an advantage over the cursory observer!</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="Text_20_body">But the great charm about my clock is its reliable uncertainty. It works on no method whatever; it is a pure emotionalist. One day it will be quite frolicsome, and gain three hours in the course of the morning, and think nothing of it; and the next day it will wish it were dead, and be hardly able to drag itself along, and lose two hours out of every four, and stop altogether in the afternoon, too miserable to do anything; and then, getting cheerful once more toward evening, will start off again of its own accord.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="Text_20_body">I do not care to talk much about this clock; because when I tell the simple truth concerning it, people think I am exaggerating.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="Text_20_body">It is very discouraging to find, when you are straining every nerve to tell the truth, that people do not believe you, and fancy that you are exaggerating. It makes you feel inclined to go and exaggerate on purpose, just to show them the difference. I know I often feel tempted to do so myself—it is my early training that saves me.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="Text_20_body"><text:soft-page-break/>We should always be very careful never to give way to exaggeration; it is a habit that grows upon one.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="Text_20_body">And it is such a vulgar habit, too. In the old times, when poets and dry-goods salesmen were the only people who exaggerated, there was something clever and <text:span text:style-name="T3">distingue</text:span> about a reputation for &quot;a tendency to over, rather than to under-estimate the mere bald facts.&quot; But everybody exaggerates nowadays. The art of exaggeration is no longer regarded as an &quot;extra&quot; in the modern bill of education; it is an essential requirement, held to be most needful for the battle of life.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="Text_20_body">The whole world exaggerates. It exaggerates everything, from the yearly number of bicycles sold to the yearly number of heathens converted—into the hope of salvation and more whiskey. Exaggeration is the basis of our trade, the fallow-field of our art and literature, the groundwork of our social life, the foundation of our political existence. As schoolboys, we exaggerate our fights and our marks and our fathers&apos; debts. As men, we exaggerate our wares, we exaggerate our feelings, we exaggerate our incomes—except to the tax-collector, and to him we exaggerate our &quot;outgoings&quot;; we exaggerate our virtues; we even exaggerate our vices, and, being in reality the mildest of men, pretend we are dare-devil scamps.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="Text_20_body">We have sunk so low now that we try to <text:span text:style-name="T3">act</text:span> our exaggerations, and to live up to our lies. We call it &quot;keeping up appearances;&quot; and no more bitter phrase could, perhaps, have been invented to describe our childish folly.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="Text_20_body">If we possess a hundred pounds a year, do we not call it two? Our larder may be low and our grates be chill, but we are happy if the &quot;world&quot; (six acquaintances and a prying neighbor) gives us credit for one hundred and fifty. And, when we have five hundred, we talk of a thousand, and the all-important and beloved &quot;world&quot; (sixteen friends now, and two of them carriage-folks!) agree that we really must be spending seven hundred, or at <text:soft-page-break/>all events, running into debt up to that figure; but the butcher and baker, who have gone into the matter with the housemaid, know better.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="Text_20_body">After awhile, having learned the trick, we launch out boldly and spend like Indian Princes—or rather <text:span text:style-name="T3">seem</text:span> to spend; for we know, by this time, how to purchase the seeming with the seeming, how to buy the appearance of wealth with the appearance of cash. And the dear old world—Beelzebub bless it! for it is his own child, sure enough; there is no mistaking the likeness, it has all his funny little ways—gathers round, applauding and laughing at the lie, and sharing in the cheat, and gloating over the thought of the blow that it knows must sooner or later fall on us from the Thor-like hammer of Truth.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="Text_20_body">And all goes merry as a witches&apos; frolic—until the gray morning dawns.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="Text_20_body">Truth and fact are old-fashioned and out-of-date, my friends, fit only for the dull and vulgar to live by. Appearance, not reality, is what the clever dog grasps at in these clever days. We spurn the dull-brown solid earth; we build our lives and homes in the fair-seeming rainbow-land of shadow and chimera.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="Text_20_body">To ourselves, sleeping and waking there, <text:span text:style-name="T3">behind</text:span> the rainbow, there is no beauty in the house; only a chill damp mist in every room, and, over all, a haunting fear of the hour when the gilded clouds will melt away, and let us fall—somewhat heavily, no doubt—upon the hard world underneath.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="Text_20_body">But, there! of what matter is <text:span text:style-name="T3">our</text:span> misery, <text:span text:style-name="T3">our</text:span> terror? To the stranger, our home appears fair and bright. The workers in the fields below look up and envy us our abode of glory and delight! If <text:span text:style-name="T3">they</text:span> think it pleasant, surely <text:span text:style-name="T3">we</text:span> should be content. Have we not been taught to live for others and not for ourselves, and are we not acting up bravely to the teaching—in this most curious method?</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="Text_20_body">Ah! yes, we are self-sacrificing enough, and loyal enough in our devotion to <text:soft-page-break/>this new-crowned king, the child of Prince Imposture and Princess Pretense. Never before was despot so blindly worshiped! Never had earthly sovereign yet such world-wide sway!</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="Text_20_body">Man, if he would live, <text:span text:style-name="T3">must</text:span> worship. He looks around, and what to him, within the vision of his life, is the greatest and the best, that he falls down and does reverence to. To him whose eyes have opened on the nineteenth century, what nobler image can the universe produce than the figure of Falsehood in stolen robes? It is cunning and brazen and hollow-hearted, and it realizes his souls ideal, and he falls and kisses its feet, and clings to its skinny knees, swearing fealty to it for evermore!</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="Text_20_body">Ah! he is a mighty monarch, bladder-bodied King Humbug! Come, let us build up temples of hewn shadows wherein we may adore him, safe from the light. Let us raise him aloft upon our Brummagem shields. Long live our coward, falsehearted chief!—fit leader for such soldiers as we! Long live the Lord-of-Lies, anointed! Long live poor King Appearances, to whom all mankind bows the knee!</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="Text_20_body">But we must hold him aloft very carefully, oh, my brother warriors! He needs much &quot;keeping up.&quot; He has no bones and sinews of his own, the poor old flimsy fellow! If we take our hands from him, he will fall a heap of worn-out rags, and the angry wind will whirl him away, and leave us forlorn. Oh, let us spend our lives keeping him up, and serving him, and making him great—that is, evermore puffed out with air and nothingness—until he burst, and we along with him!</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="Text_20_body">Burst one day he must, as it is in the nature of bubbles to burst, especially when they grow big. Meanwhile, he still reigns over us, and the world grows more and more a world of pretense and exaggeration and lies; and he who pretends and exaggerates and lies the most successfully, is the greatest of us all.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="Text_20_body"><text:soft-page-break/>The world is a gingerbread fair, and we all stand outside our booths and point to the gorgeous-colored pictures, and beat the big drum and brag. Brag! brag! Life is one great game of brag!</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="Text_20_body">&quot;Buy my soap, oh ye people, and ye will never look old, and the hair will grow again on your bald places, and ye will never be poor or unhappy again; and mine is the only true soap. Oh, beware of spurious imitations!&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="Text_20_body">&quot;Buy my lotion, all ye that suffer from pains in the head, or the stomach, or the feet, or that have broken arms, or broken hearts, or objectionable mothers-in-law; and drink one bottle a day, and all your troubles will be ended.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="Text_20_body">&quot;Come to my church, all ye that want to go to Heaven, and buy my penny weekly guide, and pay my pew-rates; and, pray ye, have nothing to do with my misguided brother over the road. <text:span text:style-name="T3">This</text:span> is the only safe way!&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="Text_20_body">&quot;Oh, vote for me, my noble and intelligent electors, and send our party into power, and the world shall be a new place, and there shall be no sin or sorrow any more! And each free and independent voter shall have a bran new Utopia made on purpose for him, according to his own ideas, with a good-sized, extra-unpleasant purgatory attached, to which he can send everybody he does not like. Oh! do not miss this chance!&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="Text_20_body">Oh! listen to my philosophy, it is the best and deepest. Oh! hear my songs, they are the sweetest. Oh! buy my pictures, they alone are true art. Oh! read my books, they are the finest.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="Text_20_body">Oh! <text:span text:style-name="T3">I</text:span> am the greatest cheesemonger, <text:span text:style-name="T3">I</text:span> am the greatest soldier, <text:span text:style-name="T3">I</text:span> am the greatest statesman, <text:span text:style-name="T3">I</text:span> am the greatest poet, <text:span text:style-name="T3">I</text:span> am the greatest showman, <text:span text:style-name="T3">I</text:span> am the greatest mountebank, <text:span text:style-name="T3">I</text:span> am the greatest editor, and <text:span text:style-name="T3">I</text:span> am the greatest patriot. <text:span text:style-name="T3">We</text:span> are the greatest nation. <text:span text:style-name="T3">We</text:span> are the only good people. <text:span text:style-name="T3">Ours</text:span> is the only true religion. Bah! how we all yell!</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="Text_20_body"><text:soft-page-break/>How we all brag and bounce, and beat the drum and shout; and nobody believes a word we utter; and the people ask one another, saying:</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="Text_20_body">&quot;How can we tell who is the greatest and the cleverest among all these shrieking braggarts?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="Text_20_body">And they answer:</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="Text_20_body">&quot;There is none great or clever. The great and clever men are not here; there is no place for them in this pandemonium of charlatans and quacks. The men you see here are crowing cocks. We suppose the greatest and the best of <text:span text:style-name="T3">them</text:span> are they who crow the loudest and the longest; that is the only test of <text:span text:style-name="T3">their</text:span> merits.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="Text_20_body">Therefore, what is left for us to do, but to crow? And the best and greatest of us all, is he who crows the loudest and the longest on this little dunghill that we call our world!</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="Text_20_body">Well, I was going to tell you about our clock.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="Text_20_body">It was my wife&apos;s idea, getting it, in the first instance. We had been to dinner at the Buggles&apos;, and Buggles had just bought a clock—&quot;picked it up in Essex,&quot; was the way he described the transaction. Buggles is always going about &quot;picking up&quot; things. He will stand before an old carved bedstead, weighing about three tons, and say:</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="Text_20_body">&quot;Yes—pretty little thing! I picked it up in Holland;&quot; as though he had found it by the roadside, and slipped it into his umbrella when nobody was looking!</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="Text_20_body">Buggles was rather full of this clock. It was of the good old-fashioned &quot;grandfather&quot; type. It stood eight feet high, in a carved-oak case, and had a deep, sonorous, solemn tick, that made a pleasant accompaniment to the after-dinner chat, and seemed to fill the room with an air of homely dignity.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="Text_20_body">We discussed the clock, and Buggles said how he loved the sound of its slow, <text:soft-page-break/>grave tick; and how, when all the house was still, and he and it were sitting up alone together, it seemed like some wise old friend talking to him, and telling him about the old days and the old ways of thought, and the old life and the old people.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="Text_20_body">The clock impressed my wife very much. She was very thoughtful all the way home, and, as we went upstairs to our flat, she said, &quot;Why could not we have a clock like that?&quot; She said it would seem like having some one in the house to take care of us all—she should fancy it was looking after baby!</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="Text_20_body">I have a man in Northamptonshire from whom I buy old furniture now and then, and to him I applied. He answered by return to say that he had got exactly the very thing I wanted. (He always has. I am very lucky in this respect.) It was the quaintest and most old-fashioned clock he had come across for a long while, and he enclosed photograph and full particulars; should he send it up?</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="Text_20_body">From the photograph and the particulars, it seemed, as he said, the very thing, and I told him, &quot;Yes; send it up at once.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="Text_20_body">Three days afterward, there came a knock at the door—there had been other knocks at the door before this, of course; but I am dealing merely with the history of the clock. The girl said a couple of men were outside, and wanted to see me, and I went to them.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="Text_20_body">I found they were Pickford&apos;s carriers, and glancing at the way-bill, I saw that it was my clock that they had brought, and I said, airily, &quot;Oh, yes, it&apos;s quite right; bring it up!&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="Text_20_body">They said they were very sorry, but that was just the difficulty. They could not get it up.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="Text_20_body">I went down with them, and wedged securely across the second landing of the staircase, I found a box which I should have judged to be the original case <text:soft-page-break/>in which Cleopatra&apos;s Needle came over.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="Text_20_body">They said that was my clock.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="Text_20_body">I brought down a chopper and a crowbar, and we sent out and collected in two extra hired ruffians and the five of us worked away for half an hour and got the clock out; after which the traffic up and down the staircase was resumed, much to the satisfaction of the other tenants.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="Text_20_body">We then got the clock upstairs and put it together, and I fixed it in the corner of the dining-room.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="Text_20_body">At first it exhibited a strong desire to topple over and fall on people, but by the liberal use of nails and screws and bits of firewood, I made life in the same room with it possible, and then, being exhausted, I had my wounds dressed, and went to bed.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="Text_20_body">In the middle of the night my wife woke me up in a great state of alarm, to say that the clock had just struck thirteen, and who did I think was going to die?</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="Text_20_body">I said I did not know, but hoped it might be the next-door dog.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="Text_20_body">My wife said she had a presentiment it meant baby. There was no comforting her; she cried herself to sleep again.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="Text_20_body">During the course of the morning, I succeeded in persuading her that she must have made a mistake, and she consented to smile once more. In the afternoon the clock struck thirteen again.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="Text_20_body">This renewed all her fears. She was convinced now that both baby and I were doomed, and that she would be left a childless widow. I tried to treat the matter as a joke, and this only made her more wretched. She said that she could see I really felt as she did, and was only pretending to be light-hearted for her sake, and she said she would try and bear it bravely.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="Text_20_body"><text:soft-page-break/>The person she chiefly blamed was Buggles.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="Text_20_body">In the night the clock gave us another warning, and my wife accepted it for her Aunt Maria, and seemed resigned. She wished, however, that I had never had the clock, and wondered when, if ever, I should get cured of my absurd craze for filling the house with tomfoolery.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="Text_20_body">The next day the clock struck thirteen four times and this cheered her up. She said that if we were all going to die, it did not so much matter. Most likely there was a fever or a plague coming, and we should all be taken together.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="Text_20_body">She was quite light-hearted over it!</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="Text_20_body">After that the clock went on and killed every friend and relation we had, and then it started on the neighbors.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="Text_20_body">It struck thirteen all day long for months, until we were sick of slaughter, and there could not have been a human being left alive for miles around.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="Text_20_body">Then it turned over a new leaf, and gave up murdering folks, and took to striking mere harmless thirty-nines and forty-ones. Its favorite number now is thirty-two, but once a day it strikes forty-nine. It never strikes more than forty-nine. I don&apos;t know why—I have never been able to understand why—but it doesn&apos;t.</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="Text_20_body">Is it that he really has grown to feel contempt for his master, and wishes to show it? They say no man is a hero to his valet; may it be that even stony-face Time himself is but a short-lived, puny mortal—a little greater than some others, that is all—to the dim eyes of this old servant of his? Has he, ticking, ticking, all these years, come at last to see into the littleness of that Time that looms so great to our awed human eyes?</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P13">Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from people in all walks of life.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P13">Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future generations. To learn more about the Project <text:soft-page-break/>Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P13">Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P13">The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit 501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P13">Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P13">Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="Text_20_body"><text:span text:style-name="T1">The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort, much </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T1">paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.

   <text:p text:style-name="P13">International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P13">Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P13">Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P13">Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P15">The neighbourhood of Bloomsbury Square towards four o’clock of a November afternoon is not so crowded as to secure to the stranger, of appearance anything out of the common, immunity from observation. Tibb’s boy, screaming at the top of his voice that <text:span text:style-name="T3">she</text:span> was his honey, stopped suddenly, stepped backwards on to the toes of a voluble young lady wheeling a perambulator, and remained deaf, apparently, to the somewhat personal remarks of the voluble young lady. Not until he had reached the next corner—and then more as a soliloquy than as information to the street—did Tibb’s boy recover sufficient interest in his own affairs to remark that <text:span text:style-name="T3">he</text:span> was her bee. The voluble young lady herself, following some half-a-dozen yards behind, forgot her wrongs in contemplation of the stranger’s back. There was this that was peculiar about the stranger’s back: that instead of being flat it presented a decided curve. “It ain’t a ‘ump, and it don’t look like kervitcher of the spine,” observed the voluble young lady to herself. “Blimy if I don’t believe ‘e’s taking ‘ome ‘is washing up his back.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">The constable at the corner, trying to seem busy doing nothing, noticed the stranger’s approach with gathering interest. “That’s an odd sort of a walk of yours, young man,” thought the constable. “You take care you don’t fall down and tumble over yourself.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“Thought he was a young man,” murmured the constable, the stranger having passed him. “He had a young face right enough.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">The daylight was fading. The stranger, finding it impossible to read the name of the street upon the corner house, turned back.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“Why, ‘tis a young man,” the constable told himself; “a mere boy.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“I beg your pardon,” said the stranger; “but would you mind telling me my <text:soft-page-break/>way to Bloomsbury Square.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“This is Bloomsbury Square,” explained the constable; “leastways round the corner is. What number might you be wanting?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">The stranger took from the ticket pocket of his tightly buttoned overcoat a piece of paper, unfolded it and read it out: “Mrs. Pennycherry. Number Forty-eight.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“Round to the left,” instructed him the constable; “fourth house. Been recommended there?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“By—by a friend,” replied the stranger. “Thank you very much.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“Ah,” muttered the constable to himself; “guess you won’t be calling him that by the end of the week, young—”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“Funny,” added the constable, gazing after the retreating figure of the stranger. “Seen plenty of the other sex as looked young behind and old in front. This cove looks young in front and old behind. Guess he’ll look old all round if he stops long at mother Pennycherry’s: stingy old cat.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">Constables whose beat included Bloomsbury Square had their reasons for not liking Mrs. Pennycherry. Indeed it might have been difficult to discover any human being with reasons for liking that sharp-featured lady. Maybe the keeping of second-rate boarding houses in the neighbourhood of Bloomsbury does not tend to develop the virtues of generosity and amiability.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">Meanwhile the stranger, proceeding upon his way, had rung the bell of Number Forty-eight. Mrs. Pennycherry, peeping from the area and catching a glimpse, above the railings, of a handsome if somewhat effeminate masculine face, hastened to readjust her widow’s cap before the looking-glass while directing Mary Jane to show the stranger, should he prove a <text:soft-page-break/>problematical boarder, into the dining-room, and to light the gas.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“And don’t stop gossiping, and don’t you take it upon yourself to answer questions. Say I’ll be up in a minute,” were Mrs. Pennycherry’s further instructions, “and mind you hide your hands as much as you can.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">***</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“What are you grinning at?” demanded Mrs. Pennycherry, a couple of minutes later, of the dingy Mary Jane.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“Wasn’t grinning,” explained the meek Mary Jane, “was only smiling to myself.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“What at?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“Dunno,” admitted Mary Jane. But still she went on smiling.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“What’s he like then?” demanded Mrs. Pennycherry.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“‘E ain’t the usual sort,” was Mary Jane’s opinion.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“Thank God for that,” ejaculated Mrs. Pennycherry piously.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“Says ‘e’s been recommended, by a friend.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“By whom?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“By a friend. ‘E didn’t say no name.” Mrs. Pennycherry pondered. “He’s not the funny sort, is he?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">Not that sort at all. Mary Jane was sure of it.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">Mrs. Pennycherry ascended the stairs still pondering. As she entered the room the stranger rose and bowed. Nothing could have been simpler than the stranger’s bow, yet there came with it to Mrs. Pennycherry a rush of old sensations long forgotten. For one brief moment Mrs. Pennycherry saw herself an amiable well-bred lady, widow of a solicitor: a visitor had called to <text:soft-page-break/>see her. It was but a momentary fancy. The next instant Reality reasserted itself. Mrs. Pennycherry, a lodging-house keeper, existing precariously upon a daily round of petty meannesses, was prepared for contest with a possible new boarder, who fortunately looked an inexperienced young gentleman.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“Someone has recommended me to you,” began Mrs. Pennycherry; “may I ask who?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">But the stranger waved the question aside as immaterial.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“You might not remember—him,” he smiled. “He thought that I should do well to pass the few months I am given—that I have to be in London, here. You can take me in?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">Mrs. Pennycherry thought that she would be able to take the stranger in.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“A room to sleep in,” explained the stranger, “—any room will do—with food and drink sufficient for a man, is all that I require.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“For breakfast,” began Mrs. Pennycherry, “I always give—”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“What is right and proper, I am convinced,” interrupted the stranger. “Pray do not trouble to go into detail, Mrs. Pennycherry. With whatever it is I shall be content.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">Mrs. Pennycherry, puzzled, shot a quick glance at the stranger, but his face, though the gentle eyes were smiling, was frank and serious.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“At all events you will see the room,” suggested Mrs. Pennycherry, “before we discuss terms.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“Certainly,” agreed the stranger. “I am a little tired and shall be glad to rest there.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">Mrs. Pennycherry led the way upward; on the landing of the third floor, paused a moment undecided, then opened the door of the back bedroom.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15"><text:soft-page-break/>“It is very comfortable,” commented the stranger.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“For this room,” stated Mrs. Pennycherry, “together with full board, consisting of—”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“Of everything needful. It goes without saying,” again interrupted the stranger with his quiet grave smile.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“I have generally asked,” continued Mrs. Pennycherry, “four pounds a week. To you—” Mrs. Pennycherry’s voice, unknown to her, took to itself the note of aggressive generosity—“seeing you have been recommended here, say three pounds ten.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“Dear lady,” said the stranger, “that is kind of you. As you have divined, I am not a rich man. If it be not imposing upon you I accept your reduction with gratitude.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">Again Mrs. Pennycherry, familiar with the satirical method, shot a suspicious glance upon the stranger, but not a line was there, upon that smooth fair face, to which a sneer could for a moment have clung. Clearly he was as simple as he looked.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“Gas, of course, extra.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“Of course,” agreed the Stranger.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“Coals—”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“We shall not quarrel,” for a third time the stranger interrupted. “You have been very considerate to me as it is. I feel, Mrs. Pennycherry, I can leave myself entirely in your hands.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">The stranger appeared anxious to be alone. Mrs. Pennycherry, having put a match to the stranger’s fire, turned to depart. And at this point it was that Mrs. Pennycherry, the holder hitherto of an unbroken record for sanity, behaved in a manner she herself, five minutes earlier in her career, would <text:soft-page-break/>have deemed impossible—that no living soul who had ever known her would have believed, even had Mrs. Pennycherry gone down upon her knees and sworn it to them.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“Did I say three pound ten?” demanded Mrs. Pennycherry of the stranger, her hand upon the door. She spoke crossly. She was feeling cross, with the stranger, with herself—particularly with herself.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“You were kind enough to reduce it to that amount,” replied the stranger; “but if upon reflection you find yourself unable—”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“I was making a mistake,” said Mrs. Pennycherry, “it should have been two pound ten.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“I cannot—I will not accept such sacrifice,” exclaimed the stranger; “the three pound ten I can well afford.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“Two pound ten are my terms,” snapped Mrs. Pennycherry. “If you are bent on paying more, you can go elsewhere. You’ll find plenty to oblige you.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">Her vehemence must have impressed the stranger. “We will not contend further,” he smiled. “I was merely afraid that in the goodness of your heart—”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“Oh, it isn’t as good as all that,” growled Mrs. Pennycherry.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“I am not so sure,” returned the stranger. “I am somewhat suspicious of you. But wilful woman must, I suppose, have her way.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">The stranger held out his hand, and to Mrs. Pennycherry, at that moment, it seemed the most natural thing in the world to take it as if it had been the hand of an old friend and to end the interview with a pleasant laugh—though laughing was an exercise not often indulged in by Mrs. Pennycherry.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">Mary Jane was standing by the window, her hands folded in front of her, when Mrs. Pennycherry re-entered the kitchen. By standing close to the window one caught a glimpse of the trees in Bloomsbury Square and <text:soft-page-break/>through their bare branches of the sky beyond.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“There’s nothing much to do for the next half hour, till Cook comes back. I’ll see to the door if you’d like a run out?” suggested Mrs. Pennycherry.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“It would be nice,” agreed the girl so soon as she had recovered power of speech; “it’s just the time of day I like.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“Don’t be longer than the half hour,” added Mrs. Pennycherry.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">Forty-eight Bloomsbury Square, assembled after dinner in the drawing-room, discussed the stranger with that freedom and frankness characteristic of Forty-eight Bloomsbury Square, towards the absent.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“Not what I call a smart young man,” was the opinion of Augustus Longcord, who was something in the City.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“Thpeaking for mythelf,” commented his partner Isidore, “hav’n’th any uthe for the thmart young man. Too many of him, ath it ith.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“Must be pretty smart if he’s one too many for you,” laughed his partner.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">There was this to be said for the repartee of Forty-eight Bloomsbury Square: it was simple of construction and easy of comprehension.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“Well it made me feel good just looking at him,” declared Miss Kite, the highly coloured. “It was his clothes, I suppose—made me think of Noah and the ark—all that sort of thing.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“It would be clothes that would make you think—if anything,” drawled the languid Miss Devine. She was a tall, handsome girl, engaged at the moment in futile efforts to recline with elegance and comfort combined upon a horsehair sofa. Miss Kite, by reason of having secured the only easy-chair, was unpopular that evening; so that Miss Devine’s remark received from the rest of the company more approbation than perhaps it merited.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15"><text:soft-page-break/>“Is that intended to be clever, dear, or only rude?” Miss Kite requested to be informed.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“Both,” claimed Miss Devine.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“Myself? I must confess,” shouted the tall young lady’s father, commonly called the Colonel, “I found him a fool.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“I noticed you seemed to be getting on very well together,” purred his wife, a plump, smiling little lady.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“Possibly we were,” retorted the Colonel. “Fate has accustomed me to the society of fools.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“Isn’t it a pity to start quarrelling immediately after dinner, you two,” suggested their thoughtful daughter from the sofa, “you’ll have nothing left to amuse you for the rest of the evening.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“He didn’t strike me as a conversationalist,” said the lady who was cousin to a baronet; “but he did pass the vegetables before he helped himself. A little thing like that shows breeding.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“Or that he didn’t know you and thought maybe you’d leave him half a spoonful,” laughed Augustus the wit.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“What I can’t make out about him—” shouted the Colonel.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">The stranger entered the room.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">The Colonel, securing the evening paper, retired into a corner. The highly coloured Kite, reaching down from the mantelpiece a paper fan, held it coyly before her face. Miss Devine sat upright on the horse-hair sofa, and rearranged her skirts.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“Know anything?” demanded Augustus of the stranger, breaking the somewhat remarkable silence.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15"><text:soft-page-break/>The stranger evidently did not understand. It was necessary for Augustus, the witty, to advance further into that odd silence.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“What’s going to pull off the Lincoln handicap? Tell me, and I’ll go out straight and put my shirt upon it.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“I think you would act unwisely,” smiled the stranger; “I am not an authority upon the subject.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“Not! Why they told me you were Captain Spy of the <text:span text:style-name="T3">Sporting Life</text:span>—in disguise.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">It would have been difficult for a joke to fall more flat. Nobody laughed, though why Mr. Augustus Longcord could not understand, and maybe none of his audience could have told him, for at Forty-eight Bloomsbury Square Mr. Augustus Longcord passed as a humorist. The stranger himself appeared unaware that he was being made fun of.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“You have been misinformed,” assured him the stranger.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“I beg your pardon,” said Mr. Augustus Longcord.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“It is nothing,” replied the stranger in his sweet low voice, and passed on.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“Well what about this theatre,” demanded Mr. Longcord of his friend and partner; “do you want to go or don’t you?” Mr. Longcord was feeling irritable.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“Goth the ticketh—may ath well,” thought Isidore.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“Damn stupid piece, I’m told.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“Motht of them thupid, more or leth. Pity to wathte the ticketh,” argued Isidore, and the pair went out.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“Are you staying long in London?” asked Miss Kite, raising her practised eyes towards the stranger.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15"><text:soft-page-break/>“Not long,” answered the stranger. “At least I do not know. It depends.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">An unusual quiet had invaded the drawing-room of Forty-eight Bloomsbury Square, generally noisy with strident voices about this hour. The Colonel remained engrossed in his paper. Mrs. Devine sat with her plump white hands folded on her lap, whether asleep or not it was impossible to say. The lady who was cousin to a baronet had shifted her chair beneath the gasolier, her eyes bent on her everlasting crochet work. The languid Miss Devine had crossed to the piano, where she sat fingering softly the tuneless keys, her back to the cold barely-furnished room.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“Sit down!” commanded saucily Miss Kite, indicating with her fan the vacant seat beside her. “Tell me about yourself. You interest me.” Miss Kite adopted a pretty authoritative air towards all youthful-looking members of the opposite sex. It harmonised with the peach complexion and the golden hair, and fitted her about as well.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“I am glad of that,” answered the stranger, taking the chair suggested. “I so wish to interest you.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“You’re a very bold boy.” Miss Kite lowered her fan, for the purpose of glancing archly over the edge of it, and for the first time encountered the eyes of the stranger looking into hers. And then it was that Miss Kite experienced precisely the same curious sensation that an hour or so ago had troubled Mrs. Pennycherry when the stranger had first bowed to her. It seemed to Miss Kite that she was no longer the Miss Kite that, had she risen and looked into it, the fly-blown mirror over the marble mantelpiece would, she knew, have presented to her view; but quite another Miss Kite—a cheerful, bright-eyed lady verging on middle age, yet still good-looking in spite of her faded complexion and somewhat thin brown locks. Miss Kite felt a pang of jealousy shoot through her; this middle-aged Miss Kite seemed, on the whole, a more attractive lady. There was a wholesomeness, a <text:soft-page-break/>broadmindedness about her that instinctively drew one towards her. Not hampered, as Miss Kite herself was, by the necessity of appearing to be somewhere between eighteen and twenty-two, this other Miss Kite could talk sensibly, even brilliantly: one felt it. A thoroughly “nice” woman this other Miss Kite; the real Miss Kite, though envious, was bound to admit it. Miss Kite wished to goodness she had never seen the woman. The glimpse of her had rendered Miss Kite dissatisfied with herself.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“I am not a boy,” explained the stranger; “and I had no intention of being bold.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“I know,” replied Miss Kite. “It was a silly remark. Whatever induced me to make it, I can’t think. Getting foolish in my old age, I suppose.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">The stranger laughed. “Surely you are not old.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“I’m thirty-nine,” snapped out Miss Kite. “You don’t call it young?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“I think it a beautiful age,” insisted the stranger; “young enough not to have lost the joy of youth, old enough to have learnt sympathy.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“Oh, I daresay,” returned Miss Kite, “any age you’d think beautiful. I’m going to bed.” Miss Kite rose. The paper fan had somehow got itself broken. She threw the fragments into the fire.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“It is early yet,” pleaded the stranger, “I was looking forward to a talk with you.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“Well, you’ll be able to look forward to it,” retorted Miss Kite. “Good-night.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">The truth was, Miss Kite was impatient to have a look at herself in the glass, in her own room with the door shut. The vision of that other Miss Kite—the clean-looking lady of the pale face and the brown hair had been so vivid, Miss Kite wondered whether temporary forgetfulness might not have fallen upon her while dressing for dinner that evening.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15"><text:soft-page-break/>The stranger, left to his own devices, strolled towards the loo table, seeking something to read.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“You seem to have frightened away Miss Kite,” remarked the lady who was cousin to a baronet.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“It seems so,” admitted the stranger.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“My cousin, Sir William Bosster,” observed the crocheting lady, “who married old Lord Egham’s niece—you never met the Eghams?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“Hitherto,” replied the stranger, “I have not had that pleasure.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“A charming family. Cannot understand—my cousin Sir William, I mean, cannot understand my remaining here. ‘My dear Emily’—he says the same thing every time he sees me: ‘My dear Emily, how can you exist among the sort of people one meets with in a boarding-house.’ But they amuse me.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">A sense of humour, agreed the stranger, was always of advantage.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“Our family on my mother’s side,” continued Sir William’s cousin in her placid monotone, “was connected with the Tatton-Joneses, who when King George the Fourth—” Sir William’s cousin, needing another reel of cotton, glanced up, and met the stranger’s gaze.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“I’m sure I don’t know why I’m telling you all this,” said Sir William’s cousin in an irritable tone. “It can’t possibly interest you.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“Everything connected with you interests me,” gravely the stranger assured her.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“It is very kind of you to say so,” sighed Sir William’s cousin, but without conviction; “I am afraid sometimes I bore people.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">The polite stranger refrained from contradiction.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“You see,” continued the poor lady, “I really am of good family.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15"><text:soft-page-break/>“Dear lady,” said the stranger, “your gentle face, your gentle voice, your gentle bearing, all proclaim it.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">She looked without flinching into the stranger’s eyes, and gradually a smile banished the reigning dulness of her features.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“How foolish of me.” She spoke rather to herself than to the stranger. “Why, of course, people—people whose opinion is worth troubling about—judge of you by what you are, not by what you go about saying you are.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">The stranger remained silent.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“I am the widow of a provincial doctor, with an income of just two hundred and thirty pounds per annum,” she argued. “The sensible thing for me to do is to make the best of it, and to worry myself about these high and mighty relations of mine as little as they have ever worried themselves about me.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">The stranger appeared unable to think of anything worth saying.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“I have other connections,” remembered Sir William’s cousin; “those of my poor husband, to whom instead of being the ‘poor relation’ I could be the fairy god-mama. They are my people—or would be,” added Sir William’s cousin tartly, “if I wasn’t a vulgar snob.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">She flushed the instant she had said the words and, rising, commenced preparations for a hurried departure.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“Now it seems I am driving you away,” sighed the stranger.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“Having been called a ‘vulgar snob,’” retorted the lady with some heat, “I think it about time I went.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“The words were your own,” the stranger reminded her.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“Whatever I may have thought,” remarked the indignant dame, “no lady—least of all in the presence of a total stranger—would have called herself—” <text:soft-page-break/>The poor dame paused, bewildered. “There is something very curious the matter with me this evening, that I cannot understand,” she explained, “I seem quite unable to avoid insulting myself.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">Still surrounded by bewilderment, she wished the stranger good-night, hoping that when next they met she would be more herself. The stranger, hoping so also, opened the door and closed it again behind her.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“Tell me,” laughed Miss Devine, who by sheer force of talent was contriving to wring harmony from the reluctant piano, “how did you manage to do it? I should like to know.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“How did I do what?” inquired the stranger.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“Contrive to get rid so quickly of those two old frumps?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“How well you play!” observed the stranger. “I knew you had genius for music the moment I saw you.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“How could you tell?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“It is written so clearly in your face.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">The girl laughed, well pleased. “You seem to have lost no time in studying my face.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“It is a beautiful and interesting face,” observed the stranger.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">She swung round sharply on the stool and their eyes met.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“You can read faces?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“Yes.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“Tell me, what else do you read in mine?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“Frankness, courage—”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“Ah, yes, all the virtues. Perhaps. We will take them for granted.” It was odd <text:soft-page-break/>how serious the girl had suddenly become. “Tell me the reverse side.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“I see no reverse side,” replied the stranger. “I see but a fair girl, bursting into noble womanhood.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“And nothing else? You read no trace of greed, of vanity, of sordidness, of—” An angry laugh escaped her lips. “And you are a reader of faces!”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“A reader of faces.” The stranger smiled. “Do you know what is written upon yours at this very moment? A love of truth that is almost fierce, scorn of lies, scorn of hypocrisy, the desire for all things pure, contempt of all things that are contemptible—especially of such things as are contemptible in woman. Tell me, do I not read aright?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">I wonder, thought the girl, is that why those two others both hurried from the room? Does everyone feel ashamed of the littleness that is in them when looked at by those clear, believing eyes of yours?</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">The idea occurred to her: “Papa seemed to have a good deal to say to you during dinner. Tell me, what were you talking about?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“The military looking gentleman upon my left? We talked about your mother principally.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“I am sorry,” returned the girl, wishful now she had not asked the question. “I was hoping he might have chosen another topic for the first evening!”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“He did try one or two,” admitted the stranger; “but I have been about the world so little, I was glad when he talked to me about himself. I feel we shall be friends. He spoke so nicely, too, about Mrs. Devine.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“Indeed,” commented the girl.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“He told me he had been married for twenty years and had never regretted it but once!”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15"><text:soft-page-break/>Her black eyes flashed upon him, but meeting his, the suspicion died from them. She turned aside to hide her smile.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“So he regretted it—once.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“Only once,” explained the stranger, “in a passing irritable mood. It was so frank of him to admit it. He told me—I think he has taken a liking to me. Indeed he hinted as much. He said he did not often get an opportunity of talking to a man like myself—he told me that he and your mother, when they travel together, are always mistaken for a honeymoon couple. Some of the experiences he related to me were really quite amusing.” The stranger laughed at recollection of them—“that even here, in this place, they are generally referred to as ‘Darby and Joan.’”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“Yes,” said the girl, “that is true. Mr. Longcord gave them that name, the second evening after our arrival. It was considered clever—but rather obvious I thought myself.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“Nothing—so it seems to me,” said the stranger, “is more beautiful than the love that has weathered the storms of life. The sweet, tender blossom that flowers in the heart of the young—in hearts such as yours—that, too, is beautiful. The love of the young for the young, that is the beginning of life. But the love of the old for the old, that is the beginning of—of things longer.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“You seem to find all things beautiful,” the girl grumbled.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“But are not all things beautiful?” demanded the stranger.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">The Colonel had finished his paper. “You two are engaged in a very absorbing conversation,” observed the Colonel, approaching them.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“We were discussing Darbies and Joans,” explained his daughter. “How beautiful is the love that has weathered the storms of life!”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“Ah!” smiled the Colonel, “that is hardly fair. My friend has been repeating to <text:soft-page-break/>cynical youth the confessions of an amorous husband’s affection for his middle-aged and somewhat—” The Colonel in playful mood laid his hand upon the stranger’s shoulder, an action that necessitated his looking straight into the stranger’s eyes. The Colonel drew himself up stiffly and turned scarlet.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">Somebody was calling the Colonel a cad. Not only that, but was explaining quite clearly, so that the Colonel could see it for himself, why he was a cad.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“That you and your wife lead a cat and dog existence is a disgrace to both of you. At least you might have the decency to try and hide it from the world—not make a jest of your shame to every passing stranger. You are a cad, sir, a cad!”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">Who was daring to say these things? Not the stranger, his lips had not moved. Besides, it was not his voice. Indeed it sounded much more like the voice of the Colonel himself. The Colonel looked from the stranger to his daughter, from his daughter back to the stranger. Clearly they had not heard the voice—a mere hallucination. The Colonel breathed again.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">Yet the impression remaining was not to be shaken off. Undoubtedly it was bad taste to have joked to the stranger upon such a subject. No gentleman would have done so.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">But then no gentleman would have permitted such a jest to be possible. No gentleman would be forever wrangling with his wife—certainly never in public. However irritating the woman, a gentleman would have exercised self-control.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">Mrs. Devine had risen, was coming slowly across the room. Fear laid hold of the Colonel. She was going to address some aggravating remark to him—he could see it in her eye—which would irritate him into savage retort.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">Even this prize idiot of a stranger would understand why boarding-house <text:soft-page-break/>wits had dubbed them “Darby and Joan,” would grasp the fact that the gallant Colonel had thought it amusing, in conversation with a table acquaintance, to hold his own wife up to ridicule.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“My dear,” cried the Colonel, hurrying to speak first, “does not this room strike you as cold? Let me fetch you a shawl.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">It was useless: the Colonel felt it. It had been too long the custom of both of them to preface with politeness their deadliest insults to each other. She came on, thinking of a suitable reply: suitable from her point of view, that is. In another moment the truth would be out. A wild, fantastic possibility flashed through the Colonel’s brain: If to him, why not to her?</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“Letitia,” cried the Colonel, and the tone of his voice surprised her into silence, “I want you to look closely at our friend. Does he not remind you of someone?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">Mrs. Devine, so urged, looked at the stranger long and hard. “Yes,” she murmured, turning to her husband, “he does, who is it?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“I cannot fix it,” replied the Colonel; “I thought that maybe you would remember.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“It will come to me,” mused Mrs. Devine. “It is someone—years ago, when I was a girl—in Devonshire. Thank you, if it isn’t troubling you, Harry. I left it in the dining-room.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">It was, as Mr. Augustus Longcord explained to his partner Isidore, the colossal foolishness of the stranger that was the cause of all the trouble. “Give me a man, who can take care of himself—or thinks he can,” declared Augustus Longcord, “and I am prepared to give a good account of myself. But when a helpless baby refuses even to look at what you call your figures, tells you that your mere word is sufficient for him, and hands you over his cheque-book to fill up for yourself—well, it isn’t playing the game.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15"><text:soft-page-break/>“Auguthuth,” was the curt comment of his partner, “you’re a fool.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“All right, my boy, you try,” suggested Augustus.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“Jutht what I mean to do,” asserted his partner.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“Well,” demanded Augustus one evening later, meeting Isidore ascending the stairs after a long talk with the stranger in the dining-room with the door shut.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“Oh, don’t arth me,” retorted Isidore, “thilly ath, thath what he ith.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“What did he say?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“What did he thay! talked about the Jewth: what a grand rathe they were—how people mithjudged them: all that thort of rot.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“Thaid thome of the motht honorable men he had ever met had been Jewth. Thought I wath one of ‘em!”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“Well, did you get anything out of him?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“Get anything out of him. Of courthe not. Couldn’t very well thell the whole rathe, ath it were, for a couple of hundred poundth, after that. Didn’t theem worth it.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">There were many things Forty-eight Bloomsbury Square came gradually to the conclusion were not worth the doing:—Snatching at the gravy; pouncing out of one’s turn upon the vegetables and helping oneself to more than one’s fair share; manoeuvering for the easy-chair; sitting on the evening paper while pretending not to have seen it—all such-like tiresome bits of business. For the little one made out of it, really it was not worth the bother. Grumbling everlastingly at one’s food; grumbling everlastingly at most things; abusing Pennycherry behind her back; abusing, for a change, one’s fellow-boarders; squabbling with one’s fellow-boarders about nothing in particular; sneering at one’s fellow-boarders; talking scandal of one’s fellow-<text:soft-page-break/>boarders; making senseless jokes about one’s fellow-boarders; talking big about oneself, nobody believing one—all such-like vulgarities. Other boarding-houses might indulge in them: Forty-eight Bloomsbury Square had its dignity to consider.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">The truth is, Forty-eight Bloomsbury Square was coming to a very good opinion of itself: for the which not Bloomsbury Square so much as the stranger must be blamed. The stranger had arrived at Forty-eight Bloomsbury Square with the preconceived idea—where obtained from Heaven knows—that its seemingly commonplace, mean-minded, coarse-fibred occupants were in reality ladies and gentlemen of the first water; and time and observation had apparently only strengthened this absurd idea. The natural result was, Forty-eight Bloomsbury Square was coming round to the stranger’s opinion of itself.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">Mrs. Pennycherry, the stranger would persist in regarding as a lady born and bred, compelled by circumstances over which she had no control to fill an arduous but honorable position of middle-class society—a sort of foster-mother, to whom were due the thanks and gratitude of her promiscuous family; and this view of herself Mrs. Pennycherry now clung to with obstinate conviction. There were disadvantages attaching, but these Mrs. Pennycherry appeared prepared to suffer cheerfully. A lady born and bred cannot charge other ladies and gentlemen for coals and candles they have never burnt; a foster-mother cannot palm off upon her children New Zealand mutton for Southdown. A mere lodging-house-keeper can play these tricks, and pocket the profits. But a lady feels she cannot: Mrs. Pennycherry felt she no longer could.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">To the stranger Miss Kite was a witty and delightful conversationalist of most attractive personality. Miss Kite had one failing: it was lack of vanity. She was unaware of her own delicate and refined beauty. If Miss Kite could only see herself with his, the stranger’s eyes, the modesty that rendered her <text:soft-page-break/>distrustful of her natural charms would fall from her. The stranger was so sure of it Miss Kite determined to put it to the test. One evening, an hour before dinner, there entered the drawing-room, when the stranger only was there and before the gas was lighted, a pleasant, good-looking lady, somewhat pale, with neatly-arranged brown hair, who demanded of the stranger if he knew her. All her body was trembling, and her voice seemed inclined to run away from her and become a sob. But when the stranger, looking straight into her eyes, told her that from the likeness he thought she must be Miss Kite’s younger sister, but much prettier, it became a laugh instead: and that evening the golden-haired Miss Kite disappeared never to show her high-coloured face again; and what perhaps, more than all else, might have impressed some former habitue of Forty-eight Bloomsbury Square with awe, it was that no one in the house made even a passing inquiry concerning her.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">Sir William’s cousin the stranger thought an acquisition to any boarding-house. A lady of high-class family! There was nothing outward or visible perhaps to tell you that she was of high-class family. She herself, naturally, would not mention the fact, yet somehow you felt it. Unconsciously she set a high-class tone, diffused an atmosphere of gentle manners. Not that the stranger had said this in so many words; Sir William’s cousin gathered that he thought it, and felt herself in agreement with him.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">For Mr. Longcord and his partner, as representatives of the best type of business men, the stranger had a great respect. With what unfortunate results to themselves has been noted. The curious thing is that the Firm appeared content with the price they had paid for the stranger’s good opinion—had even, it was rumoured, acquired a taste for honest men’s respect—that in the long run was likely to cost them dear. But we all have our pet extravagance.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">The Colonel and Mrs. Devine both suffered a good deal at first from the <text:soft-page-break/>necessity imposed upon them of learning, somewhat late in life, new tricks. In the privacy of their own apartment they condoled with one another.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“Tomfool nonsense,” grumbled the Colonel, “you and I starting billing and cooing at our age!”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“What I object to,” said Mrs. Devine, “is the feeling that somehow I am being made to do it.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“The idea that a man and his wife cannot have their little joke together for fear of what some impertinent jackanapes may think of them! it’s damn ridiculous,” the Colonel exploded.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“Even when he isn’t there,” said Mrs. Devine, “I seem to see him looking at me with those vexing eyes of his. Really the man quite haunts me.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“I have met him somewhere,” mused the Colonel, “I’ll swear I’ve met him somewhere. I wish to goodness he would go.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">A hundred things a day the Colonel wanted to say to Mrs. Devine, a hundred things a day Mrs. Devine would have liked to observe to the Colonel. But by the time the opportunity occurred—when nobody else was by to hear—all interest in saying them was gone.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“Women will be women,” was the sentiment with which the Colonel consoled himself. “A man must bear with them—must never forget that he is a gentleman.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“Oh, well, I suppose they’re all alike,” laughed Mrs. Devine to herself, having arrived at that stage of despair when one seeks refuge in cheerfulness. “What’s the use of putting oneself out—it does no good, and only upsets one.” There is a certain satisfaction in feeling you are bearing with heroic resignation the irritating follies of others. Colonel and Mrs. Devine came to enjoy the luxury of much self-approbation.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15"><text:soft-page-break/>But the person seriously annoyed by the stranger’s bigoted belief in the innate goodness of everyone he came across was the languid, handsome Miss Devine. The stranger would have it that Miss Devine was a noble-souled, high-minded young woman, something midway between a Flora Macdonald and a Joan of Arc. Miss Devine, on the contrary, knew herself to be a sleek, luxury-loving animal, quite willing to sell herself to the bidder who could offer her the finest clothes, the richest foods, the most sumptuous surroundings. Such a bidder was to hand in the person of a retired bookmaker, a somewhat greasy old gentleman, but exceedingly rich and undoubtedly fond of her.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">Miss Devine, having made up her mind that the thing had got to be done, was anxious that it should be done quickly. And here it was that the stranger’s ridiculous opinion of her not only irritated but inconvenienced her. Under the very eyes of a person—however foolish—convinced that you are possessed of all the highest attributes of your sex, it is difficult to behave as though actuated by only the basest motives. A dozen times had Miss Devine determined to end the matter by formal acceptance of her elderly admirer’s large and flabby hand, and a dozen times—the vision intervening of the stranger’s grave, believing eyes—had Miss Devine refused decided answer. The stranger would one day depart. Indeed, he had told her himself, he was but a passing traveller. When he was gone it would be easier. So she thought at the time.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">One afternoon the stranger entered the room where she was standing by the window, looking out upon the bare branches of the trees in Bloomsbury Square. She remembered afterwards, it was just such another foggy afternoon as the afternoon of the stranger’s arrival three months before. No one else was in the room. The stranger closed the door, and came towards her with that curious, quick-leaping step of his. His long coat was tightly buttoned, and in his hands he carried his old felt hat and the massive <text:soft-page-break/>knotted stick that was almost a staff.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“I have come to say good-bye,” explained the stranger. “I am going.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“I shall not see you again?” asked the girl.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“I cannot say,” replied the stranger. “But you will think of me?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“Yes,” she answered with a smile, “I can promise that.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“And I shall always remember you,” promised the stranger, “and I wish you every joy—the joy of love, the joy of a happy marriage.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">The girl winced. “Love and marriage are not always the same thing,” she said.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“Not always,” agreed the stranger, “but in your case they will be one.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">She looked at him.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“Do you think I have not noticed?” smiled the stranger, “a gallant, handsome lad, and clever. You love him and he loves you. I could not have gone away without knowing it was well with you.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">Her gaze wandered towards the fading light.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“Ah, yes, I love him,” she answered petulantly. “Your eyes can see clearly enough, when they want to. But one does not live on love, in our world. I will tell you the man I am going to marry if you care to know.” She would not meet his eyes. She kept her gaze still fixed upon the dingy trees, the mist beyond, and spoke rapidly and vehemently: “The man who can give me all my soul’s desire—money and the things that money can buy. You think me a woman, I’m only a pig. He is moist, and breathes like a porpoise; with cunning in place of a brain, and the rest of him mere stomach. But he is good enough for me.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">She hoped this would shock the stranger and that now, perhaps, he would go. It irritated her to hear him only laugh.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15"><text:soft-page-break/>“No,” he said, “you will not marry him.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“Who will stop me?” she cried angrily.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“Your Better Self.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">His voice had a strange ring of authority, compelling her to turn and look upon his face. Yes, it was true, the fancy that from the very first had haunted her. She had met him, talked to him—in silent country roads, in crowded city streets, where was it? And always in talking with him her spirit had been lifted up: she had been—what he had always thought her.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“There are those,” continued the stranger (and for the first time she saw that he was of a noble presence, that his gentle, child-like eyes could also command), “whose Better Self lies slain by their own hand and troubles them no more. But yours, my child, you have let grow too strong; it will ever be your master. You must obey. Flee from it and it will follow you; you cannot escape it. Insult it and it will chastise you with burning shame, with stinging self-reproach from day to day.” The sternness faded from the beautiful face, the tenderness crept back. He laid his hand upon the young girl’s shoulder. “You will marry your lover,” he smiled. “With him you will walk the way of sunlight and of shadow.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">And the girl, looking up into the strong, calm face, knew that it would be so, that the power of resisting her Better Self had passed away from her for ever.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“Now,” said the stranger, “come to the door with me. Leave-takings are but wasted sadness. Let me pass out quietly. Close the door softly behind me.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">She thought that perhaps he would turn his face again, but she saw no more of him than the odd roundness of his back under the tightly buttoned coat, before he faded into the gathering fog.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">Then softly she closed the door.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15"><text:soft-page-break/><text:line-break/><text:line-break/></text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:line-break/></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">Once upon a time in Zandam, which is by the Zuider Zee, there lived a wicked man named Nicholas Snyders. He was mean and hard and cruel, and loved but one thing in the world, and that was gold. And even that not for its own sake. He loved the power gold gave him—the power to tyrannize and to oppress, the power to cause suffering at his will. They said he had no soul, but there they were wrong. All men own—or, to speak more correctly, are owned by—a soul; and the soul of Nicholas Snyders was an evil soul. He lived in the old windmill which still is standing on the quay, with only little Christina to wait upon him and keep house for him. Christina was an orphan whose parents had died in debt. Nicholas, to Christina’s everlasting gratitude, had cleared their memory—it cost but a few hundred florins—in consideration that Christina should work for him without wages. Christina formed his entire household, and only one willing visitor ever darkened his door, the widow Toelast. Dame Toelast was rich and almost as great a miser as Nicholas himself. “Why should not we two marry?” Nicholas had once croaked to the widow Toelast. “Together we should be masters of all Zandam.” Dame Toelast had answered with a cackling laugh; but Nicholas was never in haste.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">One afternoon Nicholas Snyders sat alone at his desk in the centre of the great semi-circular room that took up half the ground floor of the windmill, and that served him for an office, and there came a knocking at the outer door.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“Come in!” cried Nicholas Snyders. He spoke in a tone quite kind for Nicholas Snyders. He felt so sure it was Jan knocking at the door—Jan Van <text:soft-page-break/>der Voort, the young sailor, now master of his own ship, come to demand of him the hand of little Christina. In anticipation, Nicholas Snyders tasted the joy of dashing Jan’s hopes to the ground; of hearing him plead, then rave; of watching the growing pallor that would overspread Jan’s handsome face as Nicholas would, point by point, explain to him the consequences of defiance—how, firstly, Jan’s old mother should be turned out of her home, his old father put into prison for debt; how, secondly, Jan himself should be pursued without remorse, his ship be bought over his head before he could complete the purchase. The interview would afford to Nicholas Snyders sport after his own soul. Since Jan’s return the day before, he had been looking forward to it. Therefore, feeling sure it was Jan, he cried “Come in!” quite cheerily.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">But it was not Jan. It was somebody Nicholas Snyders had never set eyes on before. And neither, after that one visit, did Nicholas Snyders ever set eyes upon him again. The light was fading, and Nicholas Snyders was not the man to light candles before they were needed, so that he was never able to describe with any precision the stranger’s appearance. Nicholas thought he seemed an old man, but alert in all his movements; while his eyes—the one thing about him Nicholas saw with any clearness—were curiously bright and piercing.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“Who are you?” asked Nicholas Snyders, taking no pains to disguise his disappointment.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“I am a pedlar,” answered the stranger. His voice was clear and not unmusical, with just the suspicion of roguishness behind.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“Not wanting anything,” answered Nicholas Snyders drily. “Shut the door and be careful of the step.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">But instead the stranger took a chair and drew it nearer, and, himself in shadow, looked straight into Nicholas Snyders’ face and laughed.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15"><text:soft-page-break/>“Are you quite sure, Nicholas Snyders? Are you quite sure there is nothing you require?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“Nothing,” growled Nicholas Snyders—“except the sight of your back.” The stranger bent forward, and with his long, lean hand touched Nicholas Snyders playfully upon the knee. “Wouldn’t you like a soul, Nicholas Snyders?” he asked.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“Think of it,” continued the strange pedlar, before Nicholas could recover power of speech. “For forty years you have drunk the joy of being mean and cruel. Are you not tired of the taste, Nicholas Snyders? Wouldn’t you like a change? Think of it, Nicholas Snyders—the joy of being loved, of hearing yourself blessed, instead of cursed! Wouldn’t it be good fun, Nicholas Snyders—just by way of a change? If you don’t like it, you can return and be yourself again.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">What Nicholas Snyders, recalling all things afterwards, could never understand was why he sat there, listening in patience to the stranger’s talk; for, at the time, it seemed to him the jesting of a wandering fool. But something about the stranger had impressed him.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“I have it with me,” continued the odd pedlar; “and as for price—” The stranger made a gesture indicating dismissal of all sordid details. “I look for my reward in watching the result of the experiment. I am something of a philosopher. I take an interest in these matters. See.” The stranger dived between his legs and produced from his pack a silver flask of cunning workmanship and laid it on the table.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“Its flavour is not unpleasant,” explained the stranger. “A little bitter; but one does not drink it by the goblet: a wineglassful, such as one would of old Tokay, while the mind of both is fixed on the same thought: ‘May my soul pass into him, may his pass into me!’ The operation is quite simple: the secret lies within the drug.” The stranger patted the quaint flask as though it had <text:soft-page-break/>been some little dog.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“You will say: ‘Who will exchange souls with Nicholas Snyders?’” The stranger appeared to have come prepared with an answer to all questions. “My friend, you are rich; you need not fear. It is the possession men value the least of all they have. Choose your soul and drive your bargain. I leave that to you with one word of counsel only: you will find the young readier than the old—the young, to whom the world promises all things for gold. Choose you a fine, fair, fresh, young soul, Nicholas Snyders; and choose it quickly. Your hair is somewhat grey, my friend. Taste, before you die, the joy of living.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">The strange pedlar laughed and, rising, closed his pack. Nicholas Snyders neither moved nor spoke, until with the soft clanging of the massive door his senses returned to him. Then, seizing the flask the stranger had left behind him, he sprang from his chair, meaning to fling it after him into the street. But the flashing of the firelight on its burnished surface stayed his hand.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“After all, the case is of value,” Nicholas chuckled, and put the flask aside and, lighting the two tall candles, buried himself again in his green-bound ledger. Yet still from time to time Nicholas Snyders’ eye would wander to where the silver flask remained half hidden among dusty papers. And later there came again a knocking at the door, and this time it really was young Jan who entered.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">Jan held out his great hand across the littered desk.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“We parted in anger, Nicholas Snyders. It was my fault. You were in the right. I ask you to forgive me. I was poor. It was selfish of me to wish the little maid to share with me my poverty. But now I am no longer poor.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“Sit down,” responded Nicholas in kindly tone. “I have heard of it. So now you are master and the owner of your ship—your very own.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“My very own after one more voyage,” laughed Jan. “I have Burgomaster <text:soft-page-break/>Allart’s promise.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“A promise is not a performance,” hinted Nicholas. “Burgomaster Allart is not a rich man; a higher bid might tempt him. Another might step in between you and become the owner.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">Jan only laughed. “Why, that would be the work of an enemy, which, God be praised, I do not think that I possess.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“Lucky lad!” commented Nicholas; “so few of us are without enemies. And your parents, Jan, will they live with you?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“We wished it,” answered Jan, “both Christina and I. But the mother is feeble. The old mill has grown into her life.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“I can understand,” agreed Nicholas. “The old vine torn from the old wall withers. And your father, Jan; people will gossip. The mill is paying?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">Jan shook his head. “It never will again; and the debts haunt him. But all that, as I tell him, is a thing of the past. His creditors have agreed to look to me and wait.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“All of them?” queried Nicholas.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“All of them I could discover,” laughed Jan.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">Nicholas Snyders pushed back his chair and looked at Jan with a smile upon his wrinkled face. “And so you and Christina have arranged it all?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“With your consent, sir,” answered Jan.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“You will wait for that?” asked Nicholas.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“We should like to have it, sir.” Jan smiled, but the tone of his voice fell agreeably on Nicholas Snyders’ ear. Nicholas Snyders loved best beating the dog that, growled and showed its teeth.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15"><text:soft-page-break/>“Better not wait for that,” said Nicholas Snyders. “You might have to wait long.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">Jan rose, an angry flush upon his face. “So nothing changes you, Nicholas Snyders. Have it your own way, then.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“You will marry her in spite of me?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“In spite of you and of your friends the fiends, and of your master the Devil!” flung out Jan. For Jan had a soul that was generous and brave and tender and excessively short-tempered. Even the best of souls have their failings.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“I am sorry,” said old Nicholas.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“I am glad to hear it,” answered Jan.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“I am sorry for your mother,” explained Nicholas. “The poor dame, I fear, will be homeless in her old age. The mortgage shall be foreclosed, Jan, on your wedding-day. I am sorry for your father, Jan. His creditors, Jan—you have overlooked just one. I am sorry for him, Jan. Prison has always been his dread. I am sorry even for you, my young friend. You will have to begin life over again. Burgomaster Allart is in the hollow of my hand. I have but to say the word, your ship is mine. I wish you joy of your bride, my young friend. You must love her very dearly—you will be paying a high price for her.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">It was Nicholas Snyders’ grin that maddened Jan. He sought for something that, thrown straight at the wicked mouth, should silence it, and by chance his hand lighted on the pedlar’s silver flask. In the same instance Nicholas Snyders’ hand had closed upon it also. The grin had died away.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“Sit down,” commanded Nicholas Snyders. “Let us talk further.” And there was that in his voice that compelled the younger man’s obedience.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“You wonder, Jan, why I seek always anger and hatred. I wonder at times myself. Why do generous thoughts never come to me, as to other men! <text:soft-page-break/>Listen, Jan; I am in a whimsical mood. Such things cannot be, but it is a whim of mine to think it might have been. Sell me your soul, Jan, sell me your soul, that I, too, may taste this love and gladness that I hear about. For a little while, Jan, only for a little while, and I will give you all you desire.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">The old man seized his pen and wrote.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“See, Jan, the ship is yours beyond mishap; the mill goes free; your father may hold up his head again. And all I ask, Jan, is that you drink to me, willing the while that your soul may go from you and become the soul of old Nicholas Snyders—for a little while, Jan, only for a little while.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">With feverish hands the old man had drawn the stopper from the pedlar’s flagon, had poured the wine into twin glasses. Jan’s inclination was to laugh, but the old man’s eagerness was almost frenzy. Surely he was mad; but that would not make less binding the paper he had signed. A true man does not jest with his soul, but the face of Christina was shining down on Jan from out the gloom.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“You will mean it?” whispered Nicholas Snyders.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“May my soul pass from me and enter into Nicholas Snyders!” answered Jan, replacing his empty glass upon the table. And the two stood looking for a moment into one another’s eyes.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">And the high candles on the littered desk flickered and went out, as though a breath had blown them, first one and then the other.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“I must be getting home,” came the voice of Jan from the darkness. “Why did you blow out the candles?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“We can light them again from the fire,” answered Nicholas. He did not add that he had meant to ask that same question of Jan. He thrust them among the glowing logs, first one and then the other; and the shadows crept back <text:soft-page-break/>into their corners.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“You will not stop and see Christina?” asked Nicholas.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“Not to-night,” answered Jan.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“The paper that I signed,” Nicholas reminded him—“you have it?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“I had forgotten it,” Jan answered.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">The old man took it from the desk and handed it to him. Jan thrust it into his pocket and went out. Nicholas bolted the door behind him and returned to his desk; sat long there, his elbow resting on the open ledger.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">Nicholas pushed the ledger aside and laughed. “What foolery! As if such things could be! The fellow must have bewitched me.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">Nicholas crossed to the fire and warmed his hands before the blaze. “Still, I am glad he is going to marry the little lass. A good lad, a good lad.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">Nicholas must have fallen asleep before the fire. When he opened his eyes, it was to meet the grey dawn. He felt cold, stiff, hungry, and decidedly cross. Why had not Christina woke him up and given him his supper. Did she think he had intended to pass the night on a wooden chair? The girl was an idiot. He would go upstairs and tell her through the door just what he thought of her.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">His way upstairs led through the kitchen. To his astonishment, there sat Christina, asleep before the burnt-out grate.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“Upon my word,” muttered Nicholas to himself, “people in this house don’t seem to know what beds are for!”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">But it was not Christina, so Nicholas told himself. Christina had the look of a frightened rabbit: it had always irritated him. This girl, even in her sleep, wore an impertinent expression—a delightfully impertinent expression. <text:soft-page-break/>Besides, this girl was pretty—marvellously pretty. Indeed, so pretty a girl Nicholas had never seen in all his life before. Why had the girls, when Nicholas was young, been so entirely different! A sudden bitterness seized Nicholas: it was as though he had just learnt that long ago, without knowing it, he had been robbed.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">The child must be cold. Nicholas fetched his fur-lined cloak and wrapped it about her.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">There was something else he ought to do. The idea came to him while drawing the cloak around her shoulders, very gently, not to disturb her—something he wanted to do, if only he could think what it was. The girl’s lips were parted. She appeared to be speaking to him, asking him to do this thing—or telling him not to do it. Nicholas could not be sure which. Half a dozen times he turned away, and half a dozen times stole back to where she sat sleeping with that delightfully impertinent expression on her face, her lips parted. But what she wanted, or what it was he wanted, Nicholas could not think.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">Perhaps Christina would know. Perhaps Christina would know who she was and how she got there. Nicholas climbed the stairs, swearing at them for creaking.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">Christina’s door was open. No one was in the room; the bed had not been slept upon. Nicholas descended the creaking stairs.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">The girl was still asleep. Could it be Christina herself? Nicholas examined the delicious features one by one. Never before, so far as he could recollect, had he seen the girl; yet around her neck—Nicholas had not noticed it before—lay Christina’s locket, rising and falling as she breathed. Nicholas knew it well; the one thing belonging to her mother Christina had insisted on keeping. The one thing about which she had ever defied him. She would never have parted with that locket. It must be Christina herself. But what <text:soft-page-break/>had happened to her? Or to himself. Remembrance rushed in upon him. The odd pedlar! The scene with Jan! But surely all that had been a dream? Yet there upon the littered desk still stood the pedlar’s silver flask, together with the twin stained glasses.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">Nicholas tried to think, but his brain was in a whirl. A ray of sunshine streaming through the window fell across the dusty room. Nicholas had never seen the sun, that he could recollect. Involuntarily he stretched his hands towards it, felt a pang of grief when it vanished, leaving only the grey light. He drew the rusty bolts, flung open the great door. A strange world lay before him, a new world of lights and shadows, that wooed him with their beauty—a world of low, soft voices that called to him. There came to him again that bitter sense of having been robbed.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“I could have been so happy all these years,” murmured old Nicholas to himself. “It is just the little town I could have loved—so quaint, so quiet, so homelike. I might have had friends, old cronies, children of my own maybe—”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">A vision of the sleeping Christina flashed before his eyes. She had come to him a child, feeling only gratitude towards him. Had he had eyes with which to see her, all things might have been different.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">Was it too late? He is not so old—not so very old. New life is in his veins. She still loves Jan, but that was the Jan of yesterday. In the future, Jan’s every word and deed will be prompted by the evil soul that was once the soul of Nicholas Snyders—that Nicholas Snyders remembers well. Can any woman love that, let the case be as handsome as you will?</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">Ought he, as an honest man, to keep the soul he had won from Jan by what might be called a trick? Yes, it had been a fair bargain, and Jan had taken his price. Besides, it was not as if Jan had fashioned his own soul; these things are chance. Why should one man be given gold, and another be given <text:soft-page-break/>parched peas? He has as much right to Jan’s soul as Jan ever had. He is wiser, he can do more good with it. It was Jan’s soul that loved Christina; let Jan’s soul win her if it can. And Jan’s soul, listening to the argument, could not think of a word to offer in opposition.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">Christina was still asleep when Nicholas re-entered the kitchen. He lighted the fire and cooked the breakfast and then aroused her gently. There was no doubt it was Christina. The moment her eyes rested on old Nicholas, there came back to her the frightened rabbit look that had always irritated him. It irritated him now, but the irritation was against himself.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“You were sleeping so soundly when I came in last night—” Christina commenced.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“And you were afraid to wake me,” Nicholas interrupted her. “You thought the old curmudgeon would be cross. Listen, Christina. You paid off yesterday the last debt your father owed. It was to an old sailor—I had not been able to find him before. Not a cent more do you owe, and there remains to you, out of your wages, a hundred florins. It is yours whenever you like to ask me for it.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">Christina could not understand, neither then nor during the days that followed; nor did Nicholas enlighten her. For the soul of Jan had entered into a very wise old man, who knew that the best way to live down the past is to live boldly the present. All that Christina could be sure of was that the old Nicholas Snyders had mysteriously vanished, that in his place remained a new Nicholas, who looked at her with kindly eyes—frank and honest, compelling confidence. Though Nicholas never said so, it came to Christina that she herself, her sweet example, her ennobling influence it was that had wrought this wondrous change. And to Christina the explanation seemed not impossible—seemed even pleasing.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">The sight of his littered desk was hateful to him. Starting early in the morning, Nicholas would disappear for the entire day, returning in the <text:soft-page-break/>evening tired but cheerful, bringing with him flowers that Christina laughed at, telling him they were weeds. But what mattered names? To Nicholas they were beautiful. In Zandam the children ran from him, the dogs barked after him. So Nicholas, escaping through byways, would wander far into the country. Children in the villages around came to know a kind old fellow who loved to linger, his hands resting on his staff, watching their play, listening to their laughter; whose ample pockets were storehouses of good things. Their elders, passing by, would whisper to one another how like he was in features to wicked old Nick, the miser of Zandam, and would wonder where he came from. Nor was it only the faces of the children that taught his lips to smile. It troubled him at first to find the world so full of marvellously pretty girls—of pretty women also, all more or less lovable. It bewildered him. Until he found that, notwithstanding, Christina remained always in his thoughts the prettiest, the most lovable of them all. Then every pretty face rejoiced him: it reminded him of Christina.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">On his return the second day, Christina had met him with sadness in her eyes. Farmer Beerstraater, an old friend of her father’s, had called to see Nicholas; not finding Nicholas, had talked a little with Christina. A hardhearted creditor was turning him out of his farm. Christina pretended not to know that the creditor was Nicholas himself, but marvelled that such wicked men could be. Nicholas said nothing, but the next day Farmer Beerstraater had called again, all smiles, blessings, and great wonder.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“But what can have come to him?” repeated Farmer Beerstraater over and over.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">Christina had smiled and answered that perhaps the good God had touched his heart; but thought to herself that perhaps it had been the good influence of another. The tale flew. Christina found herself besieged on every hand, and, finding her intercessions invariably successful, grew day by day more pleased with herself, and by consequence more pleased with Nicholas <text:soft-page-break/>Snyders. For Nicholas was a cunning old gentleman. Jan’s soul in him took delight in undoing the evil the soul of Nicholas had wrought. But the brain of Nicholas Snyders that remained to him whispered: “Let the little maid think it is all her doing.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">The news reached the ears of Dame Toelast. The same evening saw her seated in the inglenook opposite Nicholas Snyders, who smoked and seemed bored.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“You are making a fool of yourself, Nicholas Snyders,” the Dame told him. “Everybody is laughing at you.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“I had rather they laughed than cursed me,” growled Nicholas.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“Have you forgotten all that has passed between us?” demanded the Dame.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“Wish I could,” sighed Nicholas.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“At your age—” commenced the Dame.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“I am feeling younger than I ever felt in all my life,” Nicholas interrupted her.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“You don’t look it,” commented the Dame.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“What do looks matter?” snapped Nicholas. “It is the soul of a man that is the real man.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“They count for something, as the world goes,” explained the Dame. “Why, if I liked to follow your example and make a fool of myself, there are young men, fine young men, handsome young men—”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“Don’t let me stand in your way,” interposed Nicholas quickly. “As you say, I am old and I have a devil of a temper. There must be many better men than I am, men more worthy of you.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“I don’t say there are not,” returned the Dame: “but nobody more suitable. Girls for boys, and old women for old men. I haven’t lost my wits, Nicholas Snyders, if you have. When you are yourself again—”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15"><text:soft-page-break/>Nicholas Snyders sprang to his feet. “I am myself,” he cried, “and intend to remain myself! Who dares say I am not myself?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“I do,” retorted the Dame with exasperating coolness. “Nicholas Snyders is not himself when at the bidding of a pretty-faced doll he flings his money out of the window with both hands. He is a creature bewitched, and I am sorry for him. She’ll fool you for the sake of her friends till you haven’t a cent left, and then she’ll laugh at you. When you are yourself, Nicholas Snyders, you will be crazy with yourself—remember that.” And Dame Toelast marched out and slammed the door behind her.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“Girls for boys, and old women for old men.” The phrase kept ringing in his ears. Hitherto his new-found happiness had filled his life, leaving no room for thought. But the old Dame’s words had sown the seed of reflection.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">Was Christina fooling him? The thought was impossible. Never once had she pleaded for herself, never once for Jan. The evil thought was the creature of Dame Toelast’s evil mind. Christina loved him. Her face brightened at his coming. The fear of him had gone out of her; a pretty tyranny had replaced it. But was it the love that he sought? Jan’s soul in old Nick’s body was young and ardent. It desired Christina not as a daughter, but as a wife. Could it win her in spite of old Nick’s body? The soul of Jan was an impatient soul. Better to know than to doubt.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“Do not light the candles; let us talk a little by the light of the fire only,” said Nicholas. And Christina, smiling, drew her chair towards the blaze. But Nicholas sat in the shadow.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“You grow more beautiful every day, Christina,” said Nicholas-“sweeter and more womanly. He will be a happy man who calls you wife.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">The smile passed from Christina’s face. “I shall never marry,” she answered. “Never is a long word, little one.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15"><text:soft-page-break/>“A true woman does not marry the man she does not love.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“But may she not marry the man she does?” smiled Nicholas.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“Sometimes she may not,” Christina explained.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“And when is that?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">Christina’s face was turned away. “When he has ceased to love her.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">The soul in old Nick’s body leapt with joy. “He is not worthy of you, Christina. His new fortune has changed him. Is it not so? He thinks only of money. It is as though the soul of a miser had entered into him. He would marry even Dame Toelast for the sake of her gold-bags and her broad lands and her many mills, if only she would have him. Cannot you forget him?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“I shall never forget him. I shall never love another man. I try to hide it; and often I am content to find there is so much in the world that I can do. But my heart is breaking.” She rose and, kneeling beside him, clasped her hands around him. “I am glad you have let me tell you,” she said. “But for you I could not have borne it. You are so good to me.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">For answer he stroked with his withered hand the golden hair that fell disordered about his withered knees. She raised her eyes to him; they were filled with tears, but smiling.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“I cannot understand,” she said. “I think sometimes that you and he must have changed souls. He is hard and mean and cruel, as you used to be.” She laughed, and the arms around him tightened for a moment. “And now you are kind and tender and great, as once he was. It is as if the good God had taken away my lover from me to give to me a father.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“Listen to me, Christina,” he said. “It is the soul that is the man, not the body. Could you not love me for my new soul?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“But I do love you,” answered Christina, smiling through her tears.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15"><text:soft-page-break/>“Could you as a husband?” The firelight fell upon her face. Nicholas, holding it between his withered hands, looked into it long and hard; and reading what he read there, laid it back against his breast and soothed it with his withered hand.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“I was jesting, little one,” he said. “Girls for boys, and old women for old men. And so, in spite of all, you still love Jan?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“I love him,” answered Christina. “I cannot help it.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“And if he would, you would marry him, let his soul be what it may?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“I love him,” answered Christina. “I cannot help it.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">Old Nicholas sat alone before the dying fire. Is it the soul or the body that is the real man? The answer was not so simple as he had thought it.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“Christina loved Jan”—so Nicholas mumbled to the dying fire—“when he had the soul of Jan. She loves him still, though he has the soul of Nicholas Snyders. When I asked her if she could love me, it was terror I read in her eyes, though Jan’s soul is now in me; she divined it. It must be the body that is the real Jan, the real Nicholas. If the soul of Christina entered into the body of Dame Toelast, should I turn from Christina, from her golden hair, her fathomless eyes, her asking lips, to desire the shrivelled carcass of Dame Toelast? No; I should still shudder at the thought of her. Yet when I had the soul of Nicholas Snyders, I did not loathe her, while Christina was naught to me. It must be with the soul that we love, else Jan would still love Christina and I should be Miser Nick. Yet here am I loving Christina, using Nicholas Snyders’ brain and gold to thwart Nicholas Snyders’ every scheme, doing everything that I know will make him mad when he comes back into his own body; while Jan cares no longer for Christina, would marry Dame Toelast for her broad lands, her many mills. Clearly it is the soul that is the real man. Then ought I not to be glad, thinking I am going back into my own body, <text:soft-page-break/>knowing that I shall wed Christina? But I am not glad; I am very miserable. I shall not go with Jan’s soul, I feel it; my own soul will come back to me. I shall be again the hard, cruel, mean old man I was before, only now I shall be poor and helpless. The folks will laugh at me, and I shall curse them, powerless to do them evil. Even Dame Toelast will not want me when she learns all. And yet I must do this thing. So long as Jan’s soul is in me, I love Christina better than myself. I must do this for her sake. I love her—I cannot help it.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">Old Nicholas rose, took from the place, where a month before he had hidden it, the silver flask of cunning workmanship.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“Just two more glassfuls left,” mused Nicholas, as he gently shook the flask against his ear. He laid it on the desk before him, then opened once again the old green ledger, for there still remained work to be done.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">He woke Christina early. “Take these letters, Christina,” he commanded. “When you have delivered them all, but not before, go to Jan; tell him I am waiting here to see him on a matter of business.” He kissed her and seemed loth to let her go.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“I shall only be a little while,” smiled Christina.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“All partings take but a little while,” he answered.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">Old Nicholas had foreseen the trouble he would have. Jan was content, had no desire to be again a sentimental young fool, eager to saddle himself with a penniless wife. Jan had other dreams.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“Drink, man, drink!” cried Nicholas impatiently, “before I am tempted to change my mind. Christina, provided you marry her, is the richest bride in Zandam. There is the deed; read it; and read quickly.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">Then Jan consented, and the two men drank. And there passed a breath between them as before; and Jan with his hands covered his eyes a moment.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15"><text:soft-page-break/>It was a pity, perhaps, that he did so, for in that moment Nicholas snatched at the deed that lay beside Jan on the desk. The next instant it was blazing in the fire.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“Not so poor as you thought!” came the croaking voice of Nicholas. “Not so poor as you thought! I can build again, I can build again!” And the creature, laughing hideously, danced with its withered arms spread out before the blaze, lest Jan should seek to rescue Christina’s burning dowry before it was destroyed.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">Jan did not tell Christina. In spite of all Jan could say, she would go back. Nicholas Snyders drove her from the door with curses. She could not understand. The only thing clear was that Jan had come back to her.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“‘Twas a strange madness that seized upon me,” Jan explained. “Let the good sea breezes bring us health.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">So from the deck of Jan’s ship they watched old Zandam till it vanished into air.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">Christina cried a little at the thought of never seeing it again; but Jan comforted her and later new faces hid the old.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">And old Nicholas married Dame Toelast, but, happily, lived to do evil only for a few years longer.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">Long after, Jan told Christina the whole story, but it sounded very improbable, and Christina—though, of course, she did not say so—did not quite believe it, but thought Jan was trying to explain away that strange month of his life during which he had wooed Dame Toelast. Yet it certainly was strange that Nicholas, for the same short month, had been so different from his usual self.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15">“Perhaps,” thought Christina, “if I had not told him I loved Jan, he would not <text:soft-page-break/>have gone back to his old ways. Poor old gentleman! No doubt it was despair.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15"><text:line-break/><text:line-break/></text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P14">Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P14">Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from people in all walks of life.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P14">Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future generations. To learn more about the Project <text:soft-page-break/>Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.</text:p>

The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification number is 64-6221541.

   <text:p text:style-name="P14">Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P14">Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15"><text:span text:style-name="T1">The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort, much </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T1">paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state visit </text:span><text:a xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/" text:style-name="Internet_20_link" text:visited-style-name="Visited_20_Internet_20_Link"><text:span text:style-name="Definition"><text:span text:style-name="T1">www.gutenberg.org/donate</text:span></text:span></text:a><text:span text:style-name="T1">.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P14">While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who approach us with offers to donate.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P14">International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P14">Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P14">Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P14">Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P14">Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15"><text:span text:style-name="T1">Most people start at our website which has the main PG search facility: </text:span><text:a xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="https://www.gutenberg.org/" text:style-name="Internet_20_link" text:visited-style-name="Visited_20_Internet_20_Link"><text:span text:style-name="Definition"><text:span text:style-name="T1">www.gutenberg.org</text:span></text:span></text:a><text:span text:style-name="T1">.</text:span></text:p>
