            <l part="N">Is not this something more than fantasy?</l>
            <l part="N">What think you on't?</l>

            <l part="N">Before my God, I might not this believe</l>
            <l part="N">Without the sensible and true avouch</l>

          <sp>
            <speaker>HORATIO</speaker>
            <l part="N">As thou art to thyself:</l>
            <l part="N">Such was the very armour he had on</l>
            <l part="N">When he the ambitious Norway combated;</l>
            <l part="N">So frown'd he once, when, in an angry parle,</l>
            <l part="N">He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.</l>
            <l part="N">'Tis strange.</l>
          </sp>
          <sp>
            <speaker>MARCELLUS</speaker>
            <l part="N">Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour,</l>
            <l part="N">With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.</l>
          </sp>
          <sp>
            <speaker>HORATIO</speaker>
            <l part="N">In what particular thought to work I know not;</l>
            <l part="N">But in the gross and scope of my opinion,</l>
            <l part="N">This bodes some strange eruption to our state.</l>
          </sp>
          <sp>
            <speaker>MARCELLUS</speaker>
            <l part="N">Good now, sit down, and tell me, he that knows,</l>
            <l part="N">Why this same strict and most observant watch</l>
            <l part="N">So nightly toils the subject of the land,</l>
            <l part="N">And why such daily cast of brazen cannon,</l>
            <l part="N">And foreign mart for implements of war;</l>
            <l part="N">Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task</l>
            <l part="N">Does not divide the Sunday from the week;</l>
            <l part="N">What might be toward, that this sweaty haste</l>
            <l part="N">Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day:</l>
            <l part="N">Who is't that can inform me?</l>
          </sp>
          <sp>
            <speaker>HORATIO</speaker>
            <l part="N">That can I;</l>
            <l part="N">At least, the whisper goes so. Our last king,</l>
            <l part="N">Whose image even but now appear'd to us,</l>
            <l part="N">Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,</l>
            <l part="N">Thereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,</l>
            <l part="N">Dared to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet--</l>
            <l part="N">For so this side of our known world esteem'd him--</l>
            <l part="N">Did slay this Fortinbras; who by a seal'd compact,</l>
            <l part="N">Well ratified by law and heraldry,</l>
            <l part="N">Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands</l>
            <l part="N">Which he stood seized of, to the conqueror:</l>
            <l part="N">Against the which, a moiety competent</l>
            <l part="N">Was gaged by our king; which had return'd</l>
            <l part="N">To the inheritance of Fortinbras,</l>
            <l part="N">Had he been vanquisher; as, by the same covenant,</l>
            <l part="N">And carriage of the article design'd,</l>
            <l part="N">His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,</l>
            <l part="N">Of unimproved mettle hot and full,</l>
            <l part="N">Hath in the skirts of Norway here and there</l>
            <l part="N">Shark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,</l>
            <l part="N">For food and diet, to some enterprise</l>
            <l part="N">That hath a stomach in't; which is no other--</l>
            <l part="N">As it doth well appear unto our state--</l>
            <l part="N">But to recover of us, by strong hand</l>
            <l part="N">And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands</l>
            <l part="N">So by his father lost: and this, I take it,</l>
            <l part="N">Is the main motive of our preparations,</l>
            <l part="N">The source of this our watch and the chief head</l>
            <l part="N">Of this post-haste and romage in the land.</l>
          </sp>
          <sp>
            <speaker>BERNARDO</speaker>
            <l part="N">I think it be no other but e'en so:</l>
            <l part="N">Well may it sort that this portentous figure</l>
            <l part="N">Comes armed through our watch; so like the king</l>
            <l part="N">That was and is the question of these wars.</l>

            <l part="N">A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye.</l>
            <l part="N">In the most high and palmy state of Rome,</l>
            <l part="N">A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,</l>
            <l part="N">The graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead</l>
            <l part="N">Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets:</l>
            <l part="N">As stars with trains of fire and dews of blood,</l>
            <l part="N">Disasters in the sun; and the moist star</l>
            <l part="N">Upon whose influence Neptune's empire stands</l>
            <l part="N">Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse:</l>
            <l part="N">And even the like precurse of fierce events,</l>
            <l part="N">As harbingers preceding still the fates</l>
            <l part="N">And prologue to the omen coming on,</l>
            <l part="N">Have heaven and earth together demonstrated</l>
            <l part="N">Unto our climatures and countrymen.--</l>
            <l part="N">But soft, behold! lo, where it comes again!</l>
            <l part="N">Re-enter Ghost</l>
            <l part="N">I'll cross it, though it blast me. Stay, illusion!</l>
            <l part="N">If thou hast any sound, or use of voice,</l>
            <l part="N">Speak to me:</l>
            <l part="N">If there be any good thing to be done,</l>
            <l part="N">That may to thee do ease and grace to me,</l>
            <l part="N">Speak to me:</l>
            <l part="N">Cock crows</l>
            <l part="N">If thou art privy to thy country's fate,</l>
            <l part="N">Which, happily, foreknowing may avoid, O, speak!</l>
            <l part="N">Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life</l>
            <l part="N">Extorted treasure in the womb of earth,</l>
            <l part="N">For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death,</l>

This to me<lb/>In dreadful secrecy impart they did;<lb/>And I with them the third night kept the watch;<lb/>Where, as they had deliver'd, both in time,<lb/>Form of the thing, each word made true and good,<lb/>The apparition comes: I knew your father;<lb/>These hands are not more like.</l>

            <l part="N">Sir, in my heart there was a kind of fighting,<lb/>That would not let me sleep: methought I lay<lb/>Worse than the mutines in the bilboes.

But, in the<lb/>verity of extolment, I take him to be a soul of<lb/>great article; and his infusion of such dearth and<lb/>rareness, as, to make true diction of him, his<lb/>semblable is his mirror; and who else would trace<lb/>him, his umbrage, nothing more.</l>
